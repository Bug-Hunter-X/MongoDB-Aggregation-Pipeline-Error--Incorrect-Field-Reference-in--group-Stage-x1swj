# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Error: Incorrect Field Reference in $group Stage

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines: using incorrect field names within the `$group` stage.  The provided `bug.js` file contains code that uses an incorrect field name in the aggregation pipeline, leading to unexpected or incorrect results. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code.  This is a concise example to illustrate the importance of double-checking field names in MongoDB queries.

## Bug Description

The bug arises from an incorrect field name used in the `$sum` operator of the `$group` stage.  The incorrect field name prevents the aggregation from working correctly.  This can result in errors or incorrect calculations. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a MongoDB collection with sample documents.
3. Run the `bug.js` file using a MongoDB shell to see the incorrect results.
4. Run `bugSolution.js` to see the correct results.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing and verifying the field names used in the aggregation pipeline, ensuring they accurately match the field names in the collection documents.
